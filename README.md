# Context-Aware Corporate Brain (RAG)

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a **Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to act as a corporate knowledge assistant.
It ingests internal documents such as policies,SOPs,manuals and reports, converts them into vector embeddings, and retrieves most relevant context to generate accurate, document-grounded answers using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Unlike traditional chatbots,this system:
  . Answers only from provided documents
  . Prevents hallucinations
  . Provides traceable, reliable responses suitable for enterprise environments

## 🚀 Key Features

*  Document ingestion and preprocessing
*  Text chunking for efficient retrieval
*  Semantic search using vector embeddings
*  Context-aware answer generation
*  Hallucination Prevention
*  Scalable RAG architecture for enterprise use
